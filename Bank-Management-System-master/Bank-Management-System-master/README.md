# Bank-Management-System
Bank Management System standalone application using JDBC

I developed a Bank Management System using Java, JDBC, and MySQL, allowing users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check balances.

To connect the application to MySQL, I used JDBC and wrote optimized SQL queries for inserting, updating, and retrieving data. I ensured secure transactions by implementing Prepared Statements to prevent SQL injection and used transaction management to maintain consistency, especially in fund transfers.

For error handling, I added exception handling to manage cases like insufficient balance or invalid accounts. I also applied OOP principles, organizing the system into separate classes (DBConnection, AccountService, TransactionService) for better structure and maintainability.

This project strengthened my skills in Java, database management, and secure application development, providing hands-on experience in building real-world transactional systems.
